# NS1 Data
Repository for the data from the article, "Dengue Nonstructural Protein 1: A Potential Biomarker for the Evaluation of Antiviral Efficacy in Early-Phase Clinical Trials"

### in_vitro_data.csv
Used for Figure 1A and 1B. The data were from in vitro infection experiments.

### Demo_Adult.csv
Demographics and characteristics of the adult dengue patients used in the analyses (Figure 1C-D, 2A-D and 3) 

### Demo_Ped.csv
Demographics and characteristics of the pediatric dengue patients used in the analyses (Figure 1E-F, 2E-H and 3) 

### NS1_Vload_Adult.csv
Viral loads (RNA levels) and NS1 levels from the adult dengue patients by time to defervescence. The values were log10-transformed. Values noted as '0' or 'undetected' are left-censored at the lower limit of quantification (700 copies/ml for viral load and 1 ng/ml for NS1 level) for analyses.  

### NS1_Vload_Ped.csv
Viral loads (RNA levels) and NS1 levels from the pediatric dengue patients by time to defervescence. The values were log10-transformed. Values noted as '0' or 'undetected' are left-censored at the lower limit of quantification (700 copies/ml for viral load and 1 ng/ml for NS1 level) for analyses.  

### Vload_clearance_Adult.csv
Times from fever onset to viral load clearance from the adult dengue patients.

#### Vload_clearance_Ped.csv
Times from fever onset to viral load clearance from the pediatric dengue patients.

### NS1_clearance_Adult.csv
Times from fever onset to NS1 clearance from the adult dengue patients.

#### NS1_clearance_Ped.csv
Times from fever onset to NS1 clearance from the pediatric dengue patients.
